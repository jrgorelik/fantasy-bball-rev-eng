# fantasy-bball-rev-eng
An effort to make a tool to make analyzing and planning around rankings easier

Our plan will be in three parts:

First we will use the Yahoo Sports API to extract data for the 2017-2018 and 2016-2017 seasons (if possible).  The Yahoo Sports API is an open source tool with information that can be found here: https://developer.yahoo.com/fantasysports/guide/

Next we will use a variety of Machine Learning methods to try and reverse engineer the rankings (both average and total).  These results will be posted in the README

Finally, we will try and build punt rankings (and possibly a custom tool) so that others can use our findings for the good of their fantasy teams


Currently basing some of the work off of https://github.com/thorrr/YahooSports
